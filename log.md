### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 02, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Introduction to Datascience in Python - Week 2 completed.
2. Started analyzing [Stack Overflow dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey/version/2#) from kaggle.

**Thoughts** I need a better plan as to what I want to do with the dataset. Preferably I would like to create an application.
